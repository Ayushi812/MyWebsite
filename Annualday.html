    The School auditorium had been prepared for the occasion. It was decorated with flowers of paper. It looked very beautiful. The chief guest arrived on time and look his seat. He was welcomed with a bouquet of flowers presented by two nursery children.

    The cultural show began with a welcome song and a player song. The first item was presented by the nursery and K.G. students. They were dressed up as flowers and looked very lovely. They danced all around the stage without making a single mistake. Everyone clapped loudly. There was a short Odissi dance price by a very talented girl of our school. There were some solo and group songs and dances after that.
    
    Two Hindi and English skits were played too. The Hindi play was a comedy, while the English one was Shakespeare’s ‘Taming of the Shrew’. Both were appreciated very much. We also had a miming act and magic show presented by two boys.
    
    All the parents and other guests enjoyed the whole evening very much. It was a well organised show. We felt very happy when we heard the loud clapping. The Chief guest came up on the stage and gave away some prizes. He praised our school and its students very much.
